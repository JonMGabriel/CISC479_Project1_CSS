Project 1: CSS Show-and-Tell
Mimic a graphic design
Pick a physical example of graphic design, like a magazine article, a commercial product's box, a book cover, an ad, etc. Recreate this design in HTML using vanilla CSS (no preprocessors or javascript).
In your presentation tell us the dimensions of the design which are DRY and what aspects were out of reach.

Project Specific information:

Article chosen from National Geographic Expeditions (Travel Catalog 2016-2017)
Initial attempts will be to emulate the design of the cost information section however I will attempt
throughout the week to emulate the entire "A circumnavigation of Iceland article.

<!-- Below is the day_6_11 section. -->

<div id = day_6_11>
    
    <h3> Day 6: </h3>

<!-- Below is the INFORMATION section (all information is included)
Needs to be positioned in the bottom right of the page in the CSS.

<div class = information>

                    tag and how I'm using it. Given my Nat Geo article, each table row must be a different color
                    but does this merit each row to have it's own div class? -->
