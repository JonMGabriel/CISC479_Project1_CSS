Project by Jon Michael Gabriel

Project 1: CSS Show-and-Tell

Mimic a graphic design

Pick a physical example of graphic design, like a magazine article, a commercial product's box, a book cover, an ad, etc. Recreate this design in HTML using vanilla CSS (no preprocessors or javascript).

In your presentation tell us the dimensions of the design which are DRY and what aspects were out of reach.
