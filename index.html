Project 1: CSS Show-and-Tell
Mimic a graphic design
Pick a physical example of graphic design, like a magazine article, a commercial product's box, a book cover, an ad, etc. Recreate this design in HTML using vanilla CSS (no preprocessors or javascript).
In your presentation tell us the dimensions of the design which are DRY and what aspects were out of reach. 

---------------

Project Specific information:

Article chosen from National Geographic Expeditions (Travel Catalog 2016-2017)
Initial attempts will be to emulate the design of the cost information section however I will attempt
throughout the week to emulate the entire "A circumnavigation of Iceland article.

<div class = day_6_11>
        
    <h3> <div class = day_x>DAY 6</div> THE NORTHERN COAST </h3>
    
    <p> In Siglufjordur, learn about a local industry at the <br>
    Herring Museum. Continue to Akureyri for a stroll <br>
    in the old town or visit the botanical garden. <br>
    (B, L. D)</p>
    
    <h3> <div class = day_x>DAY 6</div> MYVATN AND HUSAVIK </h3>
    
    <p> Drive to Myvatn, Iceland's most geologically <br>
    active area. See bubbling mud pools at Hverarond, <br>
    the volcanic crater at Viti, and Godafoss, the <br>
    "waterfall of the gods." From Husavik, set sail <br>
    for the island of Grimsey, situated on the Arctic <br>
    Circle. (B, L, D) </p>
    
    <h3> <div class = day_x>DAY 6</div> NORTHERN ICELAND </h3>
    
    <p> Iceland's rugged east coast is an unspoiled stretch <br>
    of rocky outcrops and hidden coves. Today's <br>
    schedule is flexible so that we can take advantage <br>
    of wildlife sightings and discover the region by <br>
    Zodiac and on foot. (B, L, D) </p>
    
    <h3> <div class = day_x>DAY 6</div> DJUPIVOGUR </h3>
    
    <p>Dock in Djupivogur and venture onto the vast <br>
    Vatnajokull ice cap, the third largest in the world. <br>
    Then cruise Jokulsarlon, a lagoon strewn with <br>
    stunning icebergs of all shapes and sizes. (B, L, D)</p>
    
    <h3> <div class = day_x>DAY 6</div> WESTMAN ISLANDS </h3>
    
    <p>The volcanic Westman Islands are among the <br>
    youngest of the world's archipelagos. Sail past <br>
    Surtsey, the planet's newest island, formed in <br>
    1963 and now a UNESCO World Heritage site. On <br>
    the island of Heimaey, visit a volcanic crater still <br>
    warm from a 1973 eruption, and take in an amaz-<br>
    ing landscape engulfed by lava. (B, L, D)</p>
    
    <h3> <div class = day_x>DAY 6</div> REYKJAVIK/U.S. </h3>
    
    <p> Disembark in Reykjavik and enjoy lunch in town.<br>
    Soak in the gem-colored geothermal waters of<br>
    the Blue Lagoon before your flight home. (B, L)</p>
